Lycanthropy Template

Lycanthropy template for creating your unique Lycanthropy ability.
All the settings are in ...Mods\Lycanthropy Template\Data\s\0 replace - specific creature.erm.

In order to set up Lycanthropy ability for a creature, simply modify the settings in 0 replace - specific creature.erm to the values you like. 

The second or more Lycanthropy abilities needs to be created by copying 0 replace - specific object.erm to the same location and rename "0" to another number. Also replace all the "0_" with "[custom number]_" in the new script (by pressing "Ctrl+H" from the text editor).
