Ranged Spell Caster Template

Author: Archer30


Ranged Spell Caster template for creating your unique Ranged Spell Casting ability.
All the settings are in ...Mods\Ranged Spell Casting Template\\Data\s\0 ranged spell - creature.erm.

In order to set up Ranged Spell Casting for a creature, simply modify the settings in 0 ranged spell - creature.erm to the values you like. 

The second or more Ranged Spell Casting abilities needs to be created by copying 0 ranged spell - creature.erm to the same location and rename "0" to another number. Also replace all the "0_" with "[custom number]_" in the new script (by pressing "Ctrl+H" from the text editor).
