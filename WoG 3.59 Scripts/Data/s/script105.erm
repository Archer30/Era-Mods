** Random Battle Positions version 0.3
** Last Updated: June 22, 2006
** Previously Updated: January 2, 2006
** Script105.erm - WoG Option #305
** Idea by Treupp, Script by Timothy Pulver

** All starting positions of creatures on the battlefield (but not war machines)
** are set randomly for all battles except siege battles.

** Variables: v112; FU-n --> FU103n: FU1031-DU1032
