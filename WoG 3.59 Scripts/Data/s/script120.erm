** Human Truce version 0.9
** By Timothy Pulver
** script120.erm
** Last Updated: August 18, 2006
** Previously Updated: August 10, 2006

** This script disables combat between Human Players so that their heroes cannot
** attack other human heroes and cannot attack or capture human-controlled towns
** or external garrisons (they can be passed through with no effect). Mines and
** other flagged objects can be captured but human heroes can no longer leave
** creatures to guard mines.

** EXCEPTION: If a human hero is on a monolith, another human hero entering
** a connected monolith will result in a battle between them. I haven't yet
** found a way to prevent this.

** In addition, to prevent a situation where a human hero is used to block a
** narrow passage, garrison, or border gate, you can ctrl-click on a human hero
** to temporarily remove it. The hero will be restored on the next turn. While
** this function seems fairly stable, it should only be used when needed, and
** you should try to avoid leaving a hero in the same space as a "removed" hero,
** especially in a garrison. You cannot remove a hero who's currently visiting
** an object (other than a garrison or border gate).

** NOTE: a human hero may be used to block use of a monolith that the hero is
** currently visiting. Unfortunately, no viable solution has yet been found to
** prevent this. When temporary removal of a hero on a monolith was permitted,
** it caused the monolith to cease to function on that turn (and sometimes
** after) so it served no useful purpose.

** Computer players can attack and be attacked as normal.

** At game start, you can choose if you want the Human Truce to last the entire
** game, end when all AI players are eliminated, end after a certain number of
** days, or automatically end when the Victory Points end-game period is reached
** (if Victory Points are also enabled).

** WoG Option: 320

Human players cannot attack (or capture) human-owned towns, garrisons, or heroes except when a human hero is on the other end of a monolith that you've entered. External garrisons may be entered and mines may be captured but mine guards cannot be left. Ctrl-click on a human hero blocking your path to temporarily remove them (only affects heroes not visiting an object, other than a garrison or border gate).^; [Display opening Human Truce information message]
